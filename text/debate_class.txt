Like aren’t you clean/Because/When you get out of the shower?/ Yes, but, I use I work out two to three times a day so I would be using that same towel two to three times a day which would like it would, be totally not possible/Ok but you only need like f i v e max then/So fi, the difference of five to seven isn’t that much though/Exactly/Wait so how often do you wash your bed sheets?/Wash my bed sheets?/Yeah/It depends if people are coming over but it ya know it could be a week to two and a half weeks/Two and a half weeks?

Also at St Francis the washers and dryers are terrible, so even if I were to put one towel in with my regular clothes it actually wouldn’t dry because I’ve tried it before/You put one towel in with your/So why do you wash seven towels?/One towel each/So now if I do a load of towels.
